Last Updated: March 9, 2020

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Tiny Spoon, Inc. (“Tiny Spoon,” “we,” or “us”), our mobile application (“App”), our website at www.tinyspoonapp.com (“Website”), and other related services provided by us (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Tiny Spoon regarding your use of the Service.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:

BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING TINY SPOON’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND TINY SPOON’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY TINY SPOON AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

ARBITRATION NOTICE. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 15, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND TINY SPOON ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 15.)

    Tiny Spoon Service Overview

        Customized Dietary Content and Your Preferences. The Service creates customized grocery lists and tailors recipes from our chef-curated recipe library (“Customized Dietary Content”) on a periodic basis based on your dietary preferences, desired meal plan and portions (“Your Preferences”). You will be asked to provide us with Your Preferences in creating an account on the App, and, based on Your Preferences, the App will automatically adjust to provide you with Customized Dietary Content that is tailored to Your Preferences. 

        Delivery of Customized Dietary Content. Once you create an account and subscribe for the Service in accordance with these Terms, the Service will deliver Customized Dietary Content to you on a weekly basis. The delivered Customized Dietary Content will include a set of recipes for that week based on Your Preferences. You can choose to purchase grocery items listed in your Customized Dietary Content by whatever means you prefer, including from our App and any related delivery-services that we may make available to you through the App, from your favorite local farmers market, a nearby grocery store, or another online delivery service.

        Limitations on Customized Dietary Content. The Service only has four types of dietary preferences that it can accommodate: (1) omnivore; (2) vegetarian; (3) low-calorie; and (4) paleo, and the Service will determine which of those four types of dietary preferences most closely match Your Preferences. Recipes included in Customized Dietary Content may contain time estimates for how long the recipe should take you to complete; these are not guarantees and completing a recipe provided to you through the Service may take longer than anticipated. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER TERMS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTION 14, THE SERVICE DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANY ALLERGIES OR OTHER DIETARY RESTRICTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OR FOR ANY IMPROPER HANDLING OR STORING OF FOOD AND WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY HARM THAT YOU MAY SUSTAIN FROM PREPARING, COOKING OR EATING ANY FOOD IN CONNECTION WITH THE CUSTOM DIETARY CONTENT. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL CUSTOMIZED DIETARY CONTENT PRIOR TO USING THAT INFORMATION TO HANDLE, STORE, PREPARE OR COOK ANY FOOD, WHICH IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. 

        Purchasing Pantry and Kitchen Basics. When you view your Customized Dietary Content, the App will give you the option to purchase “pantry basics” not included in your Customized Dietary Content through our Website (“Pantry Basics”). The App also may allow you to purchase “kitchen basics,” such as pots, pans and other materials, through the Website (“Kitchen Basics”). The Pantry Basics and Kitchen Basics are not sold by us directly and are sold by third-parties, and, thus, any purchase of Pantry Basics or Kitchen Basics may be subject to third-party terms and conditions. We encourage you to read those terms and conditions prior to purchasing any Pantry Basics or Kitchen Basics linked to through the Service. 

    Eligibility. You must be at least 18-years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (1) you are at least 18-years old; (2) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (3) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.

    Accounts and Registration. To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you will need to create a password and provide us with Your Preferences, as well as some information about yourself, such as your name and email address (“Contact Information”). You agree that the Contact Information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will also be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at biteme@tinyspoonapp.com.

    General Payment Terms. Certain features of the Service require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable.

        Price. Tiny Spoon reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Tiny Spoon will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Tiny Spoon may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Tiny Spoon gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Tiny Spoon, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Tiny Spoon’s customers (for example, by making a free trial period available to users). These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

        Authorization. You authorize Tiny Spoon to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Tiny Spoon, including all applicable taxes, via third-party payment processors associated with the mobile device you downloaded the App on.

        Subscription Service. The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Tiny Spoon, Apple or Google (or any of their service providers), as applicable, depending on the platform on which you are using the Service, to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the applicable “Subscription Fee,” please see our pricing information on the Website. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We, Apple or Google (or any of their service providers), as applicable, will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by contacting biteme@tinyspoonapp.com. 

        Delinquent Accounts. Tiny Spoon may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.

    Disclaimers; No Warranties

THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TINY SPOON DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (1) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (2) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. TINY SPOON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND TINY SPOON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR TINY SPOON ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE TINY SPOON ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA.

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE NATURE OR QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT OR MATERIALS APPEARING ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ANY CUSTOM DIETARY CONTENT, AND YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS OF USING OR OTHERWISE RELYING ON THE SAME. WE WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY HARM THAT YOU MAY SUSTAIN IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE, INCLUDING ANY ARISING FROM YOUR EATING ANY FOOD BASED ON ANY CUSTOM DIETARY CONTENT. 

BY PROVIDING THE SERVICE TO YOU, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TINY SPOON IS NOT, AND WILL NOT IN THE FUTURE BE, PROVIDING YOU WITH ANY MEDICAL ADVICE, AND THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE. YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS REGARDING YOUR HEALTH AND DIETARY NEEDS.

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Tiny Spoon does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Tiny Spoon is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

    Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE TINY SPOON ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY TINY SPOON ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 15.5 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE TINY SPOON ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (1) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO TINY SPOON FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (2) $100.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

    Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

        Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Tiny Spoon in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 15.2 and 15.3, you and Tiny Spoon agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TINY SPOON ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

        Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

        Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 15 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Tiny Spoon LLC, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 70 High Street, Stoneham, Massachusetts 02180 that specifies your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Tiny Spoon receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 15 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 16.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. 

        Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Tiny Spoon will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Tiny Spoon. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

        Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Tiny Spoon’s address for Notice is: Tiny Spoon LLC, 70 High Street, Stoneham, Massachusetts 02180. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Tiny Spoon may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Tiny Spoon must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Tiny Spoon in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Tiny Spoon will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.

        Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Tiny Spoon will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Tiny Spoon for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

        No Class Actions. YOU AND TINY SPOON AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Tiny Spoon agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

        Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Tiny Spoon makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Tiny Spoon’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Tiny Spoon’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Tiny Spoon will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

        Enforceability. If Section 15.7 or the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, or if Tiny Spoon receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

    Miscellaneous

        General Terms. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Tiny Spoon regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

        Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Tiny Spoon submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Middlesex County, Massachusetts for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our offices in Massachusetts, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
